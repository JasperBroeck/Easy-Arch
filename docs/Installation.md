# Installation
In this article we'll be going over the installation process of arch linux from top to bottom. We will use the 
archinstall script for an easy installation.

## Prequisites
- A USB-stick of at least 8GB
- An arch linux iso image (downloadable [here](https://archlinux.org/download/)
- A functioning computer or android device (where you can plug your usb drive in)

## Making the bootable USB
Now you got all the prequisites figured out, you can start making your bootable USB drive by following the steps below
### On a computer: 
1. Go to the [balena etcher download page](https://etcher.balena.io/#download-etcher) and install it.
2. Open the balena etcher application and choose your arch linux iso image as the file.
3. Plug in your usb disk (**MAKE SURE THERE IS NOTHING IMPORTANT ON THERE ANYMORE**) and select it as the target.
4. Hit the "flash" button to start making the bootable usb (you might need to give administrator privileges).
5. You're done!
### On an android phone:
1. Download the EtchDroid app on the playstore from [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.depau.etchdroid&pli=1).
2. Click the "Write an image" button and choose your iso file.
3. Select your flash drive, grant access and then click "Write image"
