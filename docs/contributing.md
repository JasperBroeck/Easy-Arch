# Contributing to Easy Arch Wiki ðŸš€

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Easy Arch Wiki! This project thrives on collaboration, and we welcome helpers of all skill levelsâ€”whether youâ€™re a Linux expert or just starting out. Together, we can make Arch Linux approachable for everyone.

## Our Goal
The **Easy Arch Wiki** exists to simplify Arch Linux for beginners. Unlike the official Arch Wiki, which assumes a level of prior knowledge, this project is focused on:
- **Breaking down complex concepts** into simple, beginner-friendly terms.
- **Providing clear and concise instructions** (e.g., focusing on tools like `archinstall` instead of manual installations).
- **Highlighting practical use cases** for Arch Linux, such as setting up a desktop environment or installing software.

This wiki is **not** about replicating the official Arch Wiki. Instead, we aim to complement it by making Arch Linux accessible to new users.

## How to Contribute
We use **GitHub** to manage and host the Easy Arch Wiki with [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) under the hood for the Wiki look. You can contribute by:
1. **Forking the Repository:**  
   Clone the project to your local machine and make updates or additions.
   
2. **Creating or Editing Content:**  
   - Keep the content beginner-friendly and aligned with our goals.  
   - Use simple language and avoid overly technical terms whenever possible.  
   - Include examples, screenshots, or commands where applicable.  

3. **Submitting a Pull Request (PR):**  
   Once your changes are ready, submit a PR. Our team will review your contribution to ensure it matches the project's goals.

4. **Reporting Issues or Suggestions:**  
   If you notice any problems or have ideas for new content, feel free to open an issue on GitHub.

## Contribution Guidelines
To ensure consistency and quality, please follow these guidelines:
- **Keep it Simple:** Write for users who might be completely new to Linux.
- **Stick to the Goal:** Focus on beginner-oriented content. Avoid advanced or overly technical topics that might confuse new users.
- **Use Markdown Properly:** Format headers, lists, and code blocks correctly.  
  For example, use backticks (\`\`\`) for singular easy terminal commands: ```sudo pacman -S gnome``` or a codeblock for multiple commands:

  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel
  git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/paru.git
  cd paru
  makepkg -si
  ```
- **Be Respectful:** Constructive feedback is always welcome. Letâ€™s keep the community positive and beginner-friendly!
