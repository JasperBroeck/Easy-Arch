# Troubleshooting Guide ðŸ”§

Arch Linux is a powerful operating system, but even experienced users encounter issues from time to time. This guide will help you troubleshoot common problems effectively. Follow each step carefully, and donâ€™t hesitate to reach out for help if needed.

## General Troubleshooting Tips
1. **Stay Calm and Read the Error Message**  
   - Most issues provide a helpful error message. Look for keywords to search online or in this wiki.

2. **Check Recent Changes**  
   - Did you recently update a package, edit a configuration file, or install new software? Undoing that change can help.

3. **Refer to the Logs**  
   - Use system logs to investigate issues:
     ```bash
     journalctl -xe
     ```
   - Check logs for specific services:
     ```bash
     systemctl status <service-name>
     ```

## Common Issues and Fixes

### 0. Needs elevated, sudo or admin privileges
- **Forgot Sudo**
  - Run ```sudo <command>``` instead of just ```<command>```, fill in your root password, press enter and it should be fixed!

### 1. System Fails to Boot
- **GRUB Error:**
  - Boot into a live USB and chroot into your system:
    ```bash
    arch-chroot /mnt
    ```
  - Reinstall GRUB and regenerate the configuration:
    ```bash
    grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot --bootloader-id=GRUB
    grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
    ```

- **Kernel Panic:**
  - Check for missing kernel files or reinstall the kernel:
    ```bash
    pacman -S linux linux-headers
    ```

### 2. Network Issues
- **No Internet Connection:**
  - Ensure your network manager is running:
    ```bash
    systemctl status NetworkManager
    systemctl enable NetworkManager
    systemctl start NetworkManager
    ```
  - For Wi-Fi, use:
    ```bash
    nmcli device wifi connect <SSID> password <password>
    ```

- **Bluetooth Not Working:**
  - Install necessary tools:
    ```bash
    pacman -S bluez bluez-utils
    systemctl enable bluetooth
    systemctl start bluetooth
    ```

### 3. Sound Issues
- **No Audio Output:**
  - Check if `pulseaudio` or `pipewire` is installed and running:
    ```bash
    pulseaudio --start
    ```
  - Install missing tools:
    ```bash
    pacman -S alsa-utils pulseaudio
    ```
  - Use `alsamixer` to adjust volume levels.

### 4. Pacman Errors
- **Failed to Synchronize Databases:**
  - Update the mirrorlist:
    ```bash
    reflector --latest 10 --sort rate --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
    ```
  - Sync and update:
    ```bash
    pacman -Syyu
    ```

- **Package is Broken or Missing Dependencies:**
  - Force reinstall the package:
    ```bash
    pacman -S <package-name> --needed
    ```

### 5. Desktop Environment Issues
- **Black Screen After Login:**
  - Check if your display manager is running:
    ```bash
    systemctl status gdm
    ```
  - Reinstall GPU drivers:
    ```bash
    pacman -S nvidia nvidia-utils
    ```

- **Desktop Environment Not Loading:**
  - Manually start it with:
    ```bash
    startx
    ```
